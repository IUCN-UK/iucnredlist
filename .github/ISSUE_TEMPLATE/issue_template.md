about: Describe a bug you've seen or make a case for a new feature
---

Please briefly describe the overarching type of problem you are experiencing - such as a bug, performance regression, or a missing feature.  Please also include:
* The specific functions involved.
* Any relevant package versions.
* Links to any relevant issues, pull requests, and/or documentation.

Please include a minimal reproducible example (AKA a reprex). If you've never heard of a reprex before, the tidyverse have a good guide that would be worth reading first <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>.

Brief description of the problem

```r
# insert reprex here
```
