# Getting help with iucnredlist

Thanks for using iucnredlist!
Before filing an issue, there are a few places to explore and pieces to put together to make the process as smooth as possible.

## Where to ask?

If it's a bug, a question or feature request please [file an issue](https://github.com/IUCN-UK/iucnredlist/issues/new).  

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/IUCN-UK/iucnredlist/issues) to make sure it hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version.

By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`.

You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)  (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. 

For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.

If it's a bug, start by making a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package to include in your issue.

## What happens next?

Typically we don't look at a repo until a sufficient quantity of issues accumulates, then there’s a burst of intense activity as we focus our efforts. 
That makes development more efficient because it avoids expensive context switching between problems, at the cost of taking longer to get back to you. 
This process makes a good reprex particularly important because there might be some time between your initial report and when we start working on it.
If we can’t reproduce the bug, we can’t fix it!
